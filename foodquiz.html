            <h1>Welcome.</h1>
            <p>If you are looking at this page you have been annoyed into giving me data for my newest project. Below you can find some elaboration on the security of the this data as well as the methodolgogy post data collection</p>
            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>This is my attempt to expirment with things I want to learn. After this page you will be asked a series of 12 questions asking you a preference for food, you will also be asked to input your favorite genre of music. This will be used to determine if there is a link between food preferences and music taste. On the very likely scenario a link is not found, I plan to feed this data into an A.I. model to see if the model can determine any connections. Once this A.I. is made, I plan to make a BuzzFeed style quiz with it spitting out answers. This is not a very serious project, and is primarily being used for learning the fundamentals of A.I.</p>
            <h1>How will my data be used?</h1>
            <p>Your data will not be linked to anything except for the answer you provide for music genres, this website does not track IPs, this is a lightweight website that only takes the answer you give to the questions on the following page. See <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">here</a> for a tangentially related website.</p>
